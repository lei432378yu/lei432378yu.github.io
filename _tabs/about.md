I have long been thinking about blogging. The motive was documenting what I have learned at work and in life, as I felted that even though I read and learn a lot, only a small fraction was kept in my brain. I believe that part of the reason is that there is a lack of output mechanism. Writing up what we have learned is a way of output, if other means are unavailable. Outputs allows for closing the learning loop, identifying and filling learning gaps, sharing knowledge with whoever in need, among many other benefits. This is essentially why I am here setting off for a blogging journey.
